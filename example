Simple way to show extra text on shipping methods. Useful for when you want to add a simple line of extra detail without changing the method's name. Pure CSS. Only works on Shopify Plus.

The radio button for your shipping method will look something like this:
  <span class="radio__label__primary" data-shipping-method-label-title="DHL Parcel International Standard">
    DHL Parcel International Standard
  </span>
  
We are simply going to target the data attribute specifically for each method and add ::after to put the content we want. This is the CSS to acheive that.

<style>
  [data-shipping-method-label-title="DHL Parcel International Standard"]::after,
  [data-shipping-method-label-title="DHL Express Worldwide"]::after {
      display: block;
      font-style: italic;
      font-size: 12px;
      margin-top: 3px;
      margin-left: 49px;
      color: #666;
  }
  [data-shipping-method-label-title="DHL Parcel International Standard"]::after {
      content: "Delivery in 8-15 days";
  }
  [data-shipping-method-label-title="DHL Express Worldwide"]::after {
      content: "Delivery in 3-7 days";
  }
</style>


I also used this to show a DHL logo before the name:

<style>
  [data-shipping-method-label-title="DHL Express Worldwide"]::before,
  [data-shipping-method-label-title="DHL Parcel International Standard"]::before {
      content: "";
      background-image: url('dhl-logo.png');
      background-repeat: no-repeat;
      background-size: 40px 20px;
      width: 48px;
      height: 20px;
      display: block;
      float: left;
  }
 </style>
 
 You can grab DHL's logo right from their site: https://www.dhl.com/img/meta/dhl_logo.gif
